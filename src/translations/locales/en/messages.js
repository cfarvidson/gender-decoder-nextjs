Kay back in 2011, called <1>Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality</1> (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, July 2011, Vol 101(1), p109-128).</0><2>In this paper the researchers showed job adverts which included different kinds of gender-coded language to men and women and recorded how appealing the jobs seemed and how much the participants felt that they 'belonged' in that occupation. No non-binary people were included in this research, and the research didn't touch on non-binary-coded words.</2><3>Their results showed that women felt that job adverts with masculine-coded language were less appealing and that they belonged less in those occupations. For men, feminine-coded adverts were only slightly less appealing and there was no effect on how much the men felt they belonged in those roles.</3><4>Below are the full lists of words that this research considered masculine- and feminine-coded. This tool checks job adverts for the appearance of any of these words, then calculates the relative proportion of masculine-coded and feminine-coded words to reach an overall verdict on the gender-coding of the advert. Some words have been reduced to a 'stem' to cover a range of noun, verb and adjective variants; for instance \\\"compet\\\" covers \\\"compete\\\", \\\"competetive\\\" and \\\"competition\\\".</4>\"],\"1N9giV\":[\"<0>Without realising it, we all use language that is subtly ‘gender-coded’. Society has certain expectations of what men and women are like, and how they differ, and this seeps into the language we use. Think about “bossy” and “feisty”: we almost never use these words to describe men.</0><1>This linguistic gender-coding shows up in job adverts as well, and research has shown that it puts women off applying for jobs that are advertised with masculine-coded language.</1><2>This site is a quick way to check whether a job advert has the kind of subtle linguistic gender-coding that has this discouraging effect.</2>\"],\"CbPnFL\":[\"About this tool\"],\"mX5OEZ\":[\"All of the coded words\"],\"dtxpK2\":[\"Analyze\"],\"lYGfRP\":[\"English\"],\"coding.feminine-coded\":[\"feminine-coded\"],\"YpRlt+\":[\"Feminine-coded words\"],\"Tvlsuk\":[\"Feminine-coded words in this ad\"],\"77j778\":[\"Finding subtle bias in job ads\"],\"M0GY7d\":[\"for tech job ads\"],\"2w3TnM\":[\"Gender Decoder\"],\"sr0UJD\":[\"Go Back\"],\"vXIe7J\":[\"Language\"],\"coding.masculine-coded\":[\"masculine-coded\"],\"Gelidy\":[\"Masculine-coded words\"],\"/hmlmG\":[\"Masculine-coded words in this ad\"],\"coding.neutral\":[\"neutral\"],\"obssTo\":[\"No feminine-coded words were found.\"],\"OvuIa+\":[\"No masculine-coded words were found.\"],\"results.explainer\":[\"Of course, there are plenty of other factors that affect the diversity of applicants for this role, and of the people who end up being hired.
