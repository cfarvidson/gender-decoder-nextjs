Kay back in 2011, called <1>Evidence That Gendered Wording in Job Advertisements Exists and Sustains Gender Inequality</1> (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, July 2011, Vol 101(1), p109-128).</0><2>In this paper the researchers showed job adverts which included different kinds of gender-coded language to men and women and recorded how appealing the jobs seemed and how much the participants felt that they 'belonged' in that occupation. No non-binary people were included in this research, and the research didn't touch on non-binary-coded words.</2><3>Their results showed that women felt that job adverts with masculine-coded language were less appealing and that they belonged less in those occupations. For men, feminine-coded adverts were only slightly less appealing and there was no effect on how much the men felt they belonged in those roles.</3><4>Below are the full lists of words that this research considered masculine- and feminine-coded. This tool checks job adverts for the appearance of any of these words, then calculates the relative proportion of masculine-coded and feminine-coded words to reach an overall verdict on the gender-coding of the advert. Some words have been reduced to a 'stem' to cover a range of noun, verb and adjective variants; for instance \\\"compet\\\" covers \\\"compete\\\", \\\"competetive\\\" and \\\"competition\\\".</4>\"],\"b6UyU0\":[\"The ad does not include any coded words\"],\"coding.feminine-coded\":[\"feminine-coded\"],\"coding.masculine-coded\":[\"masculine-coded\"],\"coding.neutral\":[\"neutral\"],\"coding.strongly-feminine-coded\":[\"strongly feminine-coded\"],\"coding.strongly-masculine-coded\":[\"strongly masculine-coded\"],\"dtxpK2\":[\"Analyze\"],\"explanation.empty\":[\"This job ad doesn't use any words that are subtly coded as masculine or feminine.
